1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
It is a component library (framework). It updates the dom (Virtual Dom), which is much easier to update the real DOM on your own. It also prevents refreshing everytime there is an update.

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
To look over code to see repetitive code. To figure out where best to use components to condense everything.

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
Class/State Components are used when things are computationally complex. Function/Presentational components are more so for more simple, but repetitive parts of code.

1.  Describe state.
State is basically storage for data to be used across multiple components. (I remember this by thinking "solid state drive")

1.  Describe props.
Props or "properties" is also data passed down into components, usually from a parent. They are controlled by higher order components.
